Pause Implementation based on the Playtest
Press P button to pause
Travel to Assets > SceneManagement > Menu scene to start the game

Basic logics in Pause Implementation:
- The 'Pause' UI canvas is included in the main 'Menu' scene
- The invisible object 'PauseController' in the Menu scene contains PauseController.cs script that controls the pause feature in the game
- The object 'Pause' and 'PauseController' is included in DontDestroyOnLoad which can be active through all scenes in the game
- The pause feature is disabled in the scene 'LoadingScreen'
- If the pause mode is enabled, the game ignores all other keys except 'P' (which resumes the game) to prevent glitches
